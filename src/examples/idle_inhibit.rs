 * When a configure event is received, if a client commits the
 * surface in response to the configure event, then the client
 * must make an ack_configure request sometime before the commit
 * request, passing along the serial of the configure event.
 *
 * For instance, for toplevel surfaces the compositor might use this
 * information to move a surface to the top left only when the client has
 * drawn itself for the maximized or fullscreen state.
 *
 * If the client receives multiple configure events before it
 * can respond to one, it only has to ack the last configure event.
 *
 * A client is not required to commit immediately after sending
 * an ack_configure request - it may even ack_configure several times
 * before its next surface commit.
 *
 * A client may send multiple ack_configure requests before committing, but
 * only the last request sent before a commit indicates which configure
 * event the client really is responding to.
