 * toplevel windows, menus, etc. The types of functionality are split into

 *
 * Creating an xdg_surface does not set the role for a wl_surface. In order

 * xdg_surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role
 * not based on xdg_surface.
 *
 * A role must be assigned before any other requests are made to the
 * xdg_surface object.
 *
 * The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
 * for the xdg_surface state to take effect.
 *
 * Creating an xdg_surface from a wl_surface which has a buffer attached or
 * committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or
 * manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg_surface.configure call must
 * also be treated as errors.
 *
 * Mapping an xdg_surface-based role surface is defined as making it
 * possible for the surface to be shown by the compositor. Note that
 * a mapped surface is not guaranteed to be visible once it is mapped.
 *
 * For an xdg_surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following
 * conditions must be met:
 * (1) the client has assigned an xdg_surface-based role to the surface
 * (2) the client has set and committed the xdg_surface state and the
 * role-dependent state to the surface
 * (3) the client has committed a buffer to the surface
