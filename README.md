# wlrusts

wlrusts is a transpitlation of [swaywm/wlroots](http://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/tree/8a5e4768e1f8349ebbec815891185dbc4ea8e196) into rust using the [immunant/c2rust](http://github.com/immunant/c2rust) transpiler

Information on changes and removals during the process can be found [here](transpile-errors-8a5e4768.txt) and [here](build-errors-8a5e4768.txt)

wlrusts should not be considered working, stable, or in any way useful at the present time. Having said that, contributions to refactor it are welcome.
